### FYS-STK4155 Project 3

This repository contains the code and data for the third project of the course. It is structured as follows:

 - [pde.py](pde.py): contains the code for the analytical and numerical solution of the one-dimensional diffusion equation.
 - [pinn.py](pinn.py): contains the code for the PINN including the network architecture and training procedure.

In the code we make use of the _numpy_ and _pytorch_ libraries. For plotting we further utilize _matplotlib_.
